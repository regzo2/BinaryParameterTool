# NOTICE
### **Binary Parameter Tool is no longer maintained or supported.** 

The Binary animation conversion generated using this tool is 
very outdated and is superceeded by other projects. Please consider using 
these other projects as superior alternatives to Binary Parameter Tool. 
These other tools provide more stable and cleaner Binary parameter conversions 
for VRCFaceTracking.

* [Razgriz's VRCFTGenerator](https://github.com/rrazgriz/VRCFTGenerator) (All-in-One VRCFT animation tool)
* OSCmooth [Binary Parameters](https://github.com/Adjerry91/OSCmooth/releases/tag/V1.1.1-BETA) fork (Directly generates smoothed out Binary parameters).

### To further drive this point, I am taking down all releases of this tool. 
The source will still be available but 
seriously consider these other projects for Binary parameter implementations. 

### Thank you for your support so far! 
This was one of my very first forrays into Unity tool development. I've learned a lot 
by making this tool. There is definitely a lot I can definitely improve upon, but I am happy with where this tool has 
lead me from a learning perspective. I hope to make more awesome stuff in the future!

# **Instructions**
Simply install the included .unitypackage in your Unity project! This tool will be available on the toolbar under Tools / VRCFaceTracking.
* Tooltips available on each setting that explain what to input or do!

# **Features**
### Binary Parameter Tool comes with a few features, allowing quick and easy creation of Binary Parameter compatible Animation Layers. More is planned!

* Automatically create a Binary Parameter compatible Animation Layer with a few user-defined settings
* Configure the size of a Binary Parameter
* Supports Combined Parameters
* Tooltips on each setting.

### **Planned**
* Automatically add Binary Parameters to the Parameter List on the VRC Avatar Descriptor.
* Ability to configure multiple parameters at a time (currently only one parameter can be created at a time).
* Potential support for saving and sharing Binary configurations with above feature.
